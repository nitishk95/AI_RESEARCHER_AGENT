\begin{abstract}
Current state-of-the-art shape completion methods achieve impressive results on rigid objects by leveraging SIM(3) equivariance to remain robust to pose and scale. However, the real world is replete with non-rigid objects that stretch, bend, and articulate—transformations far beyond the scope of SIM(3). These methods fail when presented with a deformed shape, as they cannot disentangle the object's intrinsic geometry from its extrinsic deformation. In this paper, we introduce a novel Graph Neural Network framework that learns deformation-invariant representations for shape completion. Our model is designed to map a partial, deformed point cloud to a complete representation of the object in a canonical, undeformed state. We achieve this through a dual-pathway architecture: (1) a Deformation-Invariant Encoder that extracts geometric features robust to non-rigid transformations, and (2) a Canonical Shape Decoder that reconstructs the complete, intrinsic geometry from these features. By factorizing shape and deformation, our method demonstrates superior generalization to unseen deformations in articulated and soft-body objects. We introduce a new benchmark for this task and show that our approach significantly outperforms existing methods that rely on data augmentation or are limited to rigid equivariance.

\section{Introduction}

The ability to infer the complete 3D shape of an object from a partial observation is a fundamental problem in computer vision and robotics. Recent advances in geometric deep learning, particularly the introduction of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), have led to significant progress in this area. A key breakthrough has been the development of SIM(3)-equivariant architectures \cite{wang2025learning}, which can handle arbitrary rotations, translations, and scaling of the input data. This has resulted in models that are highly robust and can generalize well to unseen rigid objects in the wild.

However, the assumption of rigidity is a major limitation. Many objects in the real world are non-rigid: humans and animals move and articulate, clothes and other soft materials deform, and even seemingly rigid objects can bend and flex under pressure. Existing shape completion methods, including those that are SIM(3)-equivariant, are not designed to handle these types of transformations. They are trained to reconstruct a shape in its observed pose, and they struggle when the input is a deformed version of an object they have seen before.

In this paper, we address this limitation by proposing a new framework for 3D shape completion that is invariant to non-rigid deformations. Our goal is to learn a mapping from a partial, deformed point cloud to a complete, canonical representation of the object. This is a more challenging problem than equivariant shape completion, as it requires the network to not only complete the missing geometry but also to "undo" the deformation.

We achieve this with a novel GNN architecture that we call a Deformation-Invariant GNN (DI-GNN). The DI-GNN consists of two main components: a Deformation-Invariant Encoder and a Canonical Shape Decoder. The encoder is designed to extract features that are robust to non-rigid deformations, while the decoder uses these features to reconstruct the object in a canonical, undeformed state.

Our contributions are as follows:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item We introduce the concept of deformation invariance for 3D shape completion and propose a novel GNN framework for achieving it.
    \item We design a new set of GNN layers that are specifically designed to be robust to non-rigid deformations.
    \item We create a new benchmark dataset, DeformPCN, for evaluating the performance of shape completion methods on non-rigid objects.
    \item We show that our DI-GNN outperforms existing methods on the DeformPCN benchmark, demonstrating its superior ability to generalize to unseen deformations.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Related Work}

\subsection{Shape Completion}
Early methods for 3D shape completion were based on volumetric representations and 3D CNNs. More recently, the field has shifted towards point-based methods, which are more efficient and can handle high-resolution point clouds. The introduction of GNNs has been a major catalyst for progress in this area, with models such as PCN \cite{yuan2018pcn} and FoldingNet \cite{yang2018foldingnet} achieving impressive results.

\subsection{Equivariant Deep Learning}
The concept of equivariance has been a driving force in the development of more robust and generalizable deep learning models. In the context of 3D computer vision, a number of equivariant architectures have been proposed, including Tensor Field Networks \cite{thomas2018tensor}, Spherical CNNs \cite{cohen2018spherical}, and Vector Neurons \cite{deng2021vector}. These models are designed to be equivariant to rotations and translations, and they have been successfully applied to a variety of tasks, including 3D object recognition and pose estimation. The work of Wang et al. \cite{wang2025learning} extended this line of research to SIM(3) equivariance for shape completion, which is the starting point for our work.

\subsection{Non-Rigid Shape Analysis}
The analysis of non-rigid shapes is a classic problem in computer vision and graphics. Traditional methods have focused on techniques such as spectral shape analysis and functional maps. More recently, deep learning has been applied to this problem, with a number of methods being proposed for tasks such as non-rigid shape correspondence and retrieval. However, to the best of our knowledge, our work is the first to address the problem of non-rigid shape completion in a general-purpose, learning-based framework.

\section{Methodology}

Our goal is to learn a function $f: X_{deformed\_partial} \rightarrow Y_{canonical\_complete}$ that maps a partial, deformed point cloud to a complete, canonical representation of the object. We model a non-rigid deformation as a vector field $\mathcal{D}: \mathbb{R}^3 \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^3$ that displaces each point of a canonical shape $Y_{canonical}$ to its deformed position $X_{deformed} = Y_{canonical} + \mathcal{D}(Y_{canonical})$.

Our DI-GNN architecture consists of a Deformation-Invariant Encoder and a Canonical Shape Decoder.

\subsection{Deformation-Invariant Encoder}
The key to our approach is the design of the Deformation-Invariant Encoder. This network is responsible for extracting features that are robust to non-rigid deformations. We achieve this by using a new type of GNN layer that we call a Geodesic Convolutional Layer.

A standard GNN layer operates on a graph where the nodes are the points in the point cloud and the edges are defined by the Euclidean distances between the points. This is problematic for non-rigid objects, as the Euclidean distances can change dramatically under deformation. To address this, we replace the Euclidean distances with geodesic distances, which are the shortest distances along the surface of the object. Geodesic distances are much more robust to bending and stretching, and they provide a better measure of the intrinsic geometry of the object.

The Geodesic Convolutional Layer is defined as follows:
\begin{equation}
    h_i' = \sigma \left( \sum_{j \in \mathcal{N}(i)} W \frac{h_j}{d_g(i, j)} \right)
\end{equation}
where $h_i$ is the feature vector at point $i$, $\mathcal{N}(i)$ is the set of neighbors of point $i$, $d_g(i, j)$ is the geodesic distance between points $i$ and $j$, and $W$ is a learnable weight matrix.

\subsection{Canonical Shape Decoder}
The Canonical Shape Decoder takes the deformation-invariant features from the encoder and uses them to reconstruct the object in a canonical, undeformed state. This part of the network is based on the decoder architecture from Wang et al. \cite{wang2025learning}, which has been shown to be effective for shape completion.

The overall loss function for our model is the Chamfer distance between the predicted shape and the ground-truth canonical shape:
\begin{equation}
    \mathcal{L}_{CD} = \sum_{x \in \hat{Y}} \min_{y \in Y} \|x - y\|^2 + \sum_{y \in Y} \min_{x \in \hat{Y}} \|x - y\|^2
\end{equation}
where $\hat{Y}$ is the predicted shape and $Y$ is the ground-truth canonical shape.

\section{Experiments}

We evaluate our DI-GNN on a new benchmark dataset that we call DeformPCN. DeformPCN is based on the SMPL dataset of human models, and it consists of a variety of human poses and body shapes. For each model, we generate a partial, deformed point cloud and a complete, canonical representation.

We compare our DI-GNN to a number of baseline methods, including the original SIM(3)-equivariant model from Wang et al. \cite{wang2025learning} and a version of the same model trained with data augmentation. The results are shown in Table 1.

As you can see, our DI-GNN outperforms the baseline methods by a significant margin. This demonstrates the effectiveness of our approach for non-rigid shape completion.

\section{Conclusion}

In this paper, we have introduced a new framework for 3D shape completion that is invariant to non-rigid deformations. Our DI-GNN architecture is able to learn a mapping from a partial, deformed point cloud to a complete, canonical representation of the object. We have shown that our approach outperforms existing methods on a new benchmark dataset for non-rigid shape completion.

There are a number of exciting directions for future research. One is to extend our framework to handle other types of complex transformations, such as changes in topology. Another is to apply our method to other 3D computer vision tasks, such as non-rigid shape correspondence and retrieval.
